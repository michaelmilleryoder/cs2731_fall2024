    "text": "Late work and assignment resubmission policy\nPlease contact the instructor and TA before the deadline if you need an extension due to unforeseen circumstances. We are happy to extend deadlines for deaths and funerals, illnesses, mental health crises or episodes, weddings, important religious and national holidays, job interviews, and other circumstances. There is no shame in asking; we care about your well-being more than we care about deadlines.\nUnless you let us know beforehand (or an adverse event occurred very close to the deadline), the late penalty is 2.5% per day, including weekend days and holidays, for all assignments. The latest you may turn assignments in is 2 weeks after the deadline, excluding the final project report, which must be turned in by the deadline.\nIf you are unsatisfied with your grade on an assignment and wish to resubmit work, talk with the instructor. Resubmissions are handled case by case, but are generally accepted in cases where parts of the assignment are missing."

    "text": "Academic integrity policy\nStudents in this course will be expected to comply with the University of Pittsburgh’s Policy on Academic Integrity. Any student suspected of violating this obligation for any reason during the semester will be required to participate in the procedural process, initiated at the instructor level, as outlined in the University Guidelines on Academic Integrity To learn more about Academic Integrity, visit the Academic Integrity Guide for an overview of the topic. For hands-on practice, complete the Academic Integrity Modules.\n\nGenerative AI policy\nYou are welcome to use generative AI programs (ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc.) as a student in this course. Since much of this course is about developing such tools in NLP, using currently available tools could not only aid you in the coursework but also expose you to the current capabilities and limitations of such systems.\nHowever, your ethical responsibilities as a student remain the same. You must follow the University of Pittsburgh’s Policy on Academic Integrity. Here are some principles to keep in mind that can help you determine whether or not a specific use of generative AI is acceptable in this course (for all forms of generation: writing, code, images or other forms). Please ask the instructor if you are not sure about a specific use. You will not be blamed or retaliated against for asking.\n\nUse as an aid, not for a finished product. LLMs could be used in this course to generate ideas, draft bibliographies, study guides, etc. Use for drafting entire homework or project reports is not acceptable, even if students revise this draft, since being able to communicate NLP procedures and research is a learning objective. Also keep in mind that language models have no notion of reality and will hallucinate facts and citations.\nCite its use. The University of Pittsburgh’s academic integrity policy applies to all uncited or improperly cited use of content, whether that work is created by human beings alone or in collaboration with a generative AI. If you use a generative AI tool to develop content for an assignment, you are required to cite the tool’s contribution to your work. In practice, cutting and pasting content from any source without citation is plagiarism. Likewise, paraphrasing content from a generative AI without citation is plagiarism. Similarly, using any generative AI tool without appropriate acknowledgement will be treated as plagiarism. See the APA guidelines on how to cite ChatGPT. Publicly available LLMs are very new, and so best practices in education are still being worked out. Citing your use of LLMs will also inform the instructor on how such tools are being used in education for developing better future policies.\nYou are responsible for the work you turn in. As we will discuss in this course, LLMs and other generative AI systems can and do generate biased, socially problematic language and assert unfounded claims. Ultimately the text you submit will be treated as reflecting your own work, and you are responsible for it.\n\nAdapted from faculty in the Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy, with guidance from the Carnegie Mellon University Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence."

    "text": "Statement on scholarly discourse\nIn this course we will be discussing some complex issues on which all of us have strong feelings and, in many cases, unfounded attitudes. It is essential that we approach this endeavor with our minds open to evidence that may conflict with our presuppositions. Moreover, it is vital that we treat each other’s opinions and comments with courtesy even when they diverge and conflict with our own. We must avoid personal attacks and the use of ad hominem arguments to invalidate each other’s positions. Instead, we must develop a culture of civil argumentation, wherein all positions have the right to be defended and argued against in intellectually reasoned ways. It is this standard that everyone must accept in order to stay in this class; a standard that applies to all inquiry in the university, but whose observance is especially important in a course whose subject matter is so emotionally charged.\nAdapted from a California State University course: Race, Racism and Critical Thinking."
