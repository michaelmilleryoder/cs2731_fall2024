It is used by the instructor and TA to match groups with similar project interests and complementary abilities. Stay tuned to this page for more details!\nProject idea ranking and survey. In a form, students will rank which project ideas they would prefer to work on in a group, as well as list any personnel preferences. Teaching staff will take all of this information into account when assigning groups.\nProject pre-proposal form. In a Google Form, you will provide the type of contribution your group is interested in pursuing, as well as more specificity on the project idea. Please submit one form per group on Canvas. Teaching staff will provide some feedback and guidance on this direction in meetings.\nProject proposal and literature review. Please submit one per group on Canvas. This proposal will be a report with answers to the following questions:\n\nWhat type of contribution are you making?\nWhat is the problem or task you are focusing on?\nWhat is the nature of your contribution? That is, what is the expected output of your project? This could be a new approach and its evaluation, a new dataset, or new analysis.\nHow does your contribution build on or extend prior work? This literature review will be of at least 4 papers relevant to your project area. It will group and summarize relevant papers into types of tasks, datasets, and/or approaches. Good places to look for NLP papers include the ACL Anthology, Semantic Scholar, and Google Scholar.\nWhat data are you using (or contributing)?\nWhat algorithm or approach are you taking to address the task?\nHow are you evaluating your contribution? What performance metrics are you going to use?\nWhat kinds of ethical issues may be raised by your model or data?\nWhat are the proposed steps needed for completion of the project?\nWhat are roles and tasks of each person in the group? Though group members will contribute in various capacities, it is best if each person is responsible for at least one aspect of the project.It is recommended to start on the literature review early on, since existing work will inform your specific direction (somebody may have already tried your idea!). The instructor and TA will provide feedback on this proposal and a meeting in office hours if needed. There is no required length or format for this report, but it is recommended to use the ACL format that the final report will be formatted in. Proposals will be submitted through Canvas (one per group is fine).\n\nProject proposal presentation. In class 10-21. Groups will make a brief presentation to the class outlining their proposed project, with Q&A and opportunities for feedback from other students. Please plan for 5-minute presentations not include Q&A, which will be held right afterward for each group. Cover at least these key points:\n\nProject motivation (what is the value of this work?)\nBriefly, what 1-2 other related papers have done\nWhat data you are planning to use\nWhat approach/methods will you be taking\nEvaluation of your approach (or dataset, if it’s a dataset contribution) Please add your slides to a Google Slide presentation which will be posted in a Canvas announcement. Presentations are not graded.\n\nProject peer review. In a form, you will rate your own performance and the performance of other group members. This feedback will not be used for grading, but to identify any workload distribution issues early on and assign roles accordingly.\nProgress report. A brief (max 3 pages) progress report of a basic working system. Not everything needs to be done or fully functional, but there needs to be some sort of basic functionality. Also list any questions you have or resources you will need to successfully complete the project by the final deadline. This report should be in the ACL format that the final report will be in.\nFinal presentation. In class on 12-11. Groups will present their finished work to the group, with Q&A and feedback opportunities from students. Please prepare a maximum 5-minute presentation in which you can divide up speaking responsibilities however you see fit, though having more than one group member is encouraged. Cover at least these key points:\n\nProject motivation (briefly)\nData\nMethods, or annotation/collection approach for dataset projects\nResults Please add your slides to a Google Slide presentation which you can find in a Canvas announcement. These presentations are not graded.\n\nFinal report. Due 12-12. At the end of the course, groups will provide a written report of their project. This report will be in the ACL format found here (Overleaf template here. Include a section detailing the high-level tasks that each group member did. The report should be a maximum of 8 pages, not including references or the group member task breakdown. Additional figures or explanation in an appendix is allowed, but they will not necessarily be considered in grading. Outstanding reports would be of a quality and structure that could be submitted to an NLP workshop or conference, but other types of projects can also achieve an A."

    "title": "Project",
    "section": "Types of contributions",
    "text": "Types of contributions\nYour goal is to make a contribution, even a small one, to NLP research or practice. You can select from the following types of contributions, combine multiple of them, or define a different type of contribution with instructor approval. Example project ideas and projects are provided (with a bias toward computational social science and hate speech, the instructor’s research area). You are also encouraged to come up with their own ideas! Is there a text dataset in a field or your industry that you are familiar with that has not been analyzed? Projects can be related to students’ research, but should not be projects for other classes.\n\n1. New dataset, annotations, or analysis of existing datasets\nData is at the heart of machine learning and NLP systems; it enables further modeling and encapsulates what NLP systems “know”.\n\nExample project ideas\n\nHate speech is often expressed in a “joking” manner, yet hate speech classifiers struggle to identify hate speech in irony and humor. Build a dataset of hate speech in jokes (“light talk”) to aid future NLP classifiers. This dataset could be collected from sites that are known for both hateful content and a “humorous” tone, and portions could be annotated for hate speech and/or types of humor. This could be an expansion of prior work that provides a dataset of offense in humor: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/27446\nHate speech is culturally specific, yet the majority of NLP work focuses on English in North American and European contexts. A quantitative analysis of different features of datasets annotated for hate speech in multiple languages and from multiple cultural contexts would illuminate global similarities and culturally specific contexts.\nBuild a dataset of text from different personas from fiction roleplaying sites (“language cosplaying” in China). This could be useful for dialogue systems that adopt personas, or for story generation.\n\n\n\nExample projects\n\nNewell et al. 2017: “Verifiability” of claims made in news. New datasets often accompany the introduction of a new NLP task, which could be a previously unstudied phenomenon like verifiability in this one.\n\n\n\n\n2. New approach or application\nThis is perhaps the most common sort of NLP research contribution, in which a new method or algorithm for approaching a task (which could be a new task) is presented. Applying an existing method in a new context or task (as might be necessary in an industry setting) would also fit within this contribution.\n\nExample project ideas\nNew tasks and applications:  * New identity terms are commonly developed in online communities, some of them hateful. Develop methods to find in-group hate jargon and identity terms. * Hate speech identification without the text: Identify the discourse contexts in which hate speech is likely to occur, without allowing classifiers to look at the exact text of the hate speech. * Stancetaking, a concept from sociolinguistics, is when sepakers take an evaluative position toward the concept (which are often nuanced, e.g. “No, I actually don’t like Taylor Swift’s music that much, but she’s great as a person”). Develop automated methods for identifying the “stance object”, who the speaker is evaluating, likely from Reddit data that would be provided by the instructor. * From a set of descriptions of characters, develop a classifier to predict which ones will generate the most fanfiction. This could be a lens into online community and media norms. * Examine the framing of different entities in police Facebook posts from the Plain View Project\nExisting tasks (some ideas are pulled from Graham Neubig’s Advanced NLP class): * Lexicons are often used to identify emotional language or other concepts text analysts may be interested in measuring in large corpora. Develop and evaluate approaches for expanding lexicons to specific contexts. This could be applied to expand lists of identity terms in a variety of online communities, with data supplied by the instructor. * Any of the SemEval 2021 tasks * X-FACTR multilingual knowledge probing in QA * GoEmotions Fine-grained Emotion Detection Dataset * SciREX Scientific Information Extraction * Subjective Intent Classification in Discourse * Very Low Resource machine translation * Predict the points at which speakers switch languages when code-switching * Sign language translation * Develop best approaches for training hate speech classifiers that generalize across targeted identities. Data would be provided by the instructor * Style transfer of offensive language into inoffensive language. See existing paper and dataset+code. * Develop new approaches for hate speech detection by comparing with knowledge bases or pretrained models of stereotypes from a stereotype dataset * Cross-lingual emotion detection. See existing paper. * Multilingual content moderation on Reddit. See existing paper and dataset.\n\n\n\n4. New survey or position paper\nSurveys are especially needed for new, emerging research areas. All projects will require a literature review, but a survey paper would be both broader and deeper. It would summarize key approaches and key challenges and present lines for future work. Some sort of implementation is necessary for this type of contribution as well, such as applying multiple established methods to a new dataset or in a new context to show challenges that need to be addressed. Position papers argue for a certain viewpoint or shortcoming of existing approaches, e.g. arguing for the utility of techniques from a discipline outside NLP in NLP tasks.\n\nExample project ideas\n\nSurvey how NLP is used and applied in other fields. What has been our most useful contributions to scholars in the social sciences, physical sciences, or humanities? This survey would assemble papers across disciplines for mentions of NLP and summarize what is most useful, what is lacking, and what approaches from NLP could be helpful to others.\nComputational social science using NLP generally relies on data from online communities. But this is missing non-online interactions and the practices of those who are not active online. Survey datasets and approaches that use quantitative and computational techniques on recordings of offline linguistic interaction.\nA growing area of research in computational social science aims to capture the framing and portrayal of entities across large text corpora (such as in news media). Survey existing approaches and challenges."

    "section": "How your project will be graded",
    "text": "How your project will be graded\nTo get an A, your group’s project should make progress toward an achievable, concrete contribution specified in your project proposal. The project does not necessarily need to be successful in the sense that it outperforms baselines or contributes to our knowledge of a phenomenon. Sometimes ideas don’t work, and that’s okay. But you need to provide evidence of progress toward that contribution. If you are building a dataset, for example, the dataset needs to be built in some form, even if it is as not as large or as useful as you may have hoped. If you are evaluating a new method for a task, you must have an implementation that tests that method against other baselines, even if it doesn’t perform as well as you would have hoped or you didn’t get to evaluate it against all the baselines you wanted to. If you are doing a survey, you must distill a sufficient number of papers into themes that comprehensively describe a research area, even if you don’t end up finding groundbreaking gaps in knowledge that must be addressed. Feel free to take on more risky ideas, but only if you know you’ll have something to show for it at the end. Teaching staff will guide you toward scoping projects that should fulfill this goal in the planning phase through the proposal."

Any student suspected of violating this obligation for any reason during the semester will be required to participate in the procedural process, initiated at the instructor level, as outlined in the University Guidelines on Academic Integrity To learn more about Academic Integrity, visit the Academic Integrity Guide for an overview of the topic. For hands-on practice, complete the Academic Integrity Modules.\n\nGenerative AI policy\nYou are allowed to use generative AI programs (ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc.) as a student in this course in limited circumstances. Since much of this course is about developing such tools in NLP, using currently available tools can expose you to the current capabilities and limitations of such systems.\nHowever, your ethical responsibilities as a student remain the same. You must follow the University of Pittsburgh’s Policy on Academic Integrity. Here are some principles to keep in mind that can help you determine whether or not a specific use of generative AI is acceptable in this course (for all forms of generation: writing, code, images or other forms). Please ask the instructor if you are not sure about a specific use. You will not be blamed or retaliated against for asking.\n\nUse as an aid, not for a finished product. LLMs could be used in this course to generate ideas, draft bibliographies, study guides, etc. Use for drafting entire homework or project reports is not acceptable, even if students revise this draft, since being able to communicate NLP procedures and research is a learning objective. Also keep in mind that language models have no notion of reality and will hallucinate facts and citations.\nCite its use. The University of Pittsburgh’s academic integrity policy applies to all uncited or improperly cited use of content, whether that work is created by human beings alone or in collaboration with a generative AI. If you use a generative AI tool to develop content for an assignment, you are required to cite the tool’s contribution to your work. In practice, cutting and pasting content from any source without citation is plagiarism. Likewise, paraphrasing content from a generative AI without citation is plagiarism. Similarly, using any generative AI tool without appropriate acknowledgement will be treated as plagiarism. See the APA guidelines on how to cite ChatGPT. Publicly available LLMs are very new, and so best practices in education are still being worked out. Citing your use of LLMs will also inform the instructor on how such tools are being used in education for developing better future policies.\nYou are responsible for the work you turn in. As we will discuss in this course, LLMs and other generative AI systems can and do generate biased, socially problematic language and assert unfounded claims. Ultimately the text you submit will be treated as reflecting your own work, and you are responsible for it.\n\nAdapted from faculty in the Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy, with guidance from the Carnegie Mellon University Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence."
